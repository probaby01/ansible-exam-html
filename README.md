# Static HTML for Nginx Deployment

This repository contains the **HTML file used for automated deployment via Ansible** to two AWS EC2 instances running Nginx. The project was part of my **AltSchool Africa Cloud Engineering 2nd Semester Examination**, where I deployed a website using:

- **AWS EC2 + Classic Load Balancer**
- **Ansible Automation**
- **AWS S3 Static Website Hosting**
